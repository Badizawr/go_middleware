##Task

-

You have 1 hour to solve the task. If you are lucky enough and have time left, please try to optimise your solution.

Build a middleware using echo framework
First of all, you should create a handler which sends how many days left until 1 Jan 2025 and response with HTTP 200 OK status code.

Secondly, build a middleware, which checks HTTP header User-Role presents and contains admin and prints red button user detected to the console (using default log package or any 3rd party) if so.

###Run

go run cmd/mw-test-task/main.go

```

###Test

```

curl --location --request GET '127.0.0.1:8080/status' \
--header 'User-Role: admin'

```
